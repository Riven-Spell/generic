# generic


[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/Riven-Spell/generic.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Riven-Spell/generic) ![GitHub go.mod Go version](https://img.shields.io/github/go-mod/go-version/Riven-Spell/generic)

Tools to interact with generics in golang, generically.

There are no rules about what will make it into this package-- If it's something I find myself rewriting, and it interacts with generics, I'll probably put it here and use it again.

This is not a package in itself, but many subpackages interacting with their named components.
